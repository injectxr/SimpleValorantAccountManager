## **FAQ**

**Q. Is this software safe?** 

<br>
As far as the source code is concerned, there is nothing malicious. You can check it yourself or ask someone who knows how if you don't know how. Just get the Riot client and let pyautogui automatically log you in like you always type in yourself.
</br>
<br>

**Q. Is my registered account safe?**

<br>
Yes it is safe. This app is a Tikinker study program.
This app was distributed to get feedback.
I don't have the technology to steal accounts, but techs could steal accounts if they wanted to. I don't want to steal people's accounts, and I can't do it because it's too much responsibility for me if the stolen information is detected.

We are positively considering making this program source public, but I would like you to know that you can create a remodeled application that is distributed secondary.
